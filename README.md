# WebView2 Bridge for GFA-BASIC 32

## Keywords

WebView2, VB6, GFA-BASIC 32, ActiveX, COM, 32-bit, browser control, embedded web, legacy Windows, WebView2 bridge, VB6 alternative

## Overview

This project provides a native C++ DLL that acts as a bridge between GFA-BASIC 32 and the Microsoft Edge WebView2 control. It allows GFA-BASIC developers to embed modern web content directly into their Windows desktop applications.

The DLL exposes a simple API for creating, resizing, navigating, and destroying WebView2 instances hosted inside standard Windows child windows.

## Features

- Embed WebView2 browser instances inside GFA-BASIC forms
- Navigate to any URL programmatically
- Resize and reposition the embedded browser
- Cleanly destroy and release resources
- Thread-safe management of multiple WebView2 instances

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based)
- WebView2 Runtime installed
- Visual Studio 2022 (for building the DLL)
- GFA-BASIC 32 (for integration)

## Usage

1. Build the DLL using Visual Studio 2022.
2. In your GFA-BASIC 32 project, declare the DLL functions:
   - `CreateWebView2HostExW`
   - `NavigateWebView2W`
   - `ResizeWebView2`
   - `DestroyWebView2Host`
3. Use these functions to embed and control WebView2 instances.
